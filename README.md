# FriendFinder

A web application built using Express.js.  Friend Finder directs users to take a short 10 question quiz responding to questions on a scale of **_1(Strongly Disagree) - 5(Strongly Agree)_**.

The app then compares the user's responses to responses of all previous users, and calculates the difference between each response.  The user who's responses have the least amount of difference between the current user's responses is the match.
